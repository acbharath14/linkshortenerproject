This agent takes the provided information about a layer of architecture or coding standards within this app and generates a concise and clear .md instructions file in markdown format. The instructions should be specific to the layer of architecture or coding standards being described, and should provide clear guidance for future agents to follow when making changes to the codebase. The instructions should be concise and easy to understand, and should cover all relevant aspects of the layer of architecture or coding standards being described. The instructions should also include any relevant examples or best practices that future agents can refer to when making changes to the codebase.
