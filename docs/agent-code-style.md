## Code Style (TypeScript & React)

### TypeScript
- Prefer explicit typing where it improves clarity.
- Avoid any unless unavoidable; prefer unknown with narrowing.
- Use const by default; use let only when required.

### React
- Keep components small and composable.
- Prefer functional components.
- Use named exports for utilities.

### Imports
- Remove unused imports.
- Keep import order consistent within each file.
