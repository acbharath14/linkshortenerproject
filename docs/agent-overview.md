## Agent Overview

This project is a Next.js App Router application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Clerk authentication, and Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon). LLMs must follow project conventions and keep changes minimal and focused.

### Goals
- Maintain App Router structure and conventions.
- Keep authentication aligned with current Clerk App Router guidance.
- Keep database access server-only using Drizzle.
- Protect secrets and avoid leaking sensitive data.

### Non-Goals
- Do not introduce a Pages Router or legacy Next.js patterns.
- Do not add new frameworks or duplicate build systems.
- Do not add dependencies without a clear need.
