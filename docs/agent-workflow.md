## Agent Workflow

### Before Editing
- Read relevant files to understand context.
- Prefer small, targeted changes.
- Keep file structure consistent with existing patterns.

### Editing Rules
- Use TypeScript for app code.
- Keep components small and composable.
- Avoid large refactors unless required.
- Do not add new dependencies without a clear reason.

### After Editing
- Ensure no unused imports or variables.
- Ensure changes align with ESLint and TypeScript checks.
- Confirm no secrets were added or logged.
